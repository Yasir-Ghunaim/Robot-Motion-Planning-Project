## Installation
The project uses Python version 2.7.16 and numpy library.

To run the tester, use the following command: 
`python tester.py test_maze_01.txt`

And to run the maze visualization use this command:
`python showmaze.py test_maze_01.txt`
The script uses the turtle module to visualize the maze. You can click on the window with the visualization after drawing is complete to close the window.

## File Structure
The project contains these files:

    robot.py - This script establishes the robot class.                       
    maze.py - This script contains functions for constructing the maze and for checking for walls upon robot movement or sensing.
    tester.py - This script will be run to test the robotâ€™s ability to navigate mazes.
    showmaze.py - This script can be used to create a visual demonstration of what a maze looks like.
    test_maze_##.txt - These files provide three sample mazes upon which to test your robot.
    free_form_maze.txt - This file has an additional maze used for evaluation purpose.

## Project Motivation
Navigation is a major task for mobile robots. In real applications, this task can be really complicated with a lot of elements such as obstacle avoidance, object recognition and path planning. Handling all of these tasks at once is quite tough. In this project, we only deal with finding the optimum path which could be integrated later with a more complex project.
